# EthereumLottery

EthereumLotter is a minor lottery contract that operates on the Ethereum blockchain and enables hosting of- and taking part in lotteries without any single authority. Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the platform, is the cryptocurrency dealt in.

Anyone can initiate a lottery, and anyone is eligible to participate. Multiple entries into the same lottery result in a higher chance of winning but higher risk.
